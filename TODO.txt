TODO:

1. Finish setting up boundary conditions for mobile sink path.
2. Set up routing protocol (possibly similar to https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6040374)
3. Use topologies other than tree topology and record impact on energy statistics
4. Also address costs of sending + receiving hello packets & other advertisement packets (varies w number of dead/alive nodes)
5. Get publishable statistics w comparison against other protocols

// Does this still technically count as a clustering algorithm?
// Also are we aiming for a new protocol or algorithm?
